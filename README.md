# WordPress-vs.-Kali
# Project 7 - WordPress Pen Testing

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## Notes

I was successfully able to follow the steps up to Lab 2 Part 2, but then I was no longer able to access the WordPress website on my browser after following "Open the Hole" step. I tried to search online to attempt to fix it, but couldn't find anything useful. I also went to office hours and after attempting to fix with the TA (Jackie Friedberg), but we couldn't. We made sure that the website was up by pinging both on PowerShell and Kali Terminal, we also tried restarting the device, but we still couldn't get it working.

Below is the error I have seen:
